Internet is one of the important inventions and a large number of persons are its users. People use this media for different purposes. There are different social media platforms that are accessible to these users. Any user can make a post or spread the news through these online platforms. These platforms do not verify the users or their posts. So, some of the users try to spread fake news through these platforms. This fake news can be a propaganda against an individual, society, organization or political party. A human being is unable to detect all these fake news. So, there is a need for machine learning model that can detect this fake news automatically.
Our objective is to build a classification model which accurately classify a piece of news as real or fake. This method used Naive Bayes classification model to predict whether a news is real or fake as this classifier will work better on text data. The other machine learning techniques were also used to compare the results. So fake news classification problem can be addressed with different machine learning methods. We used Python as a language to implement the proposed method. We applied the proposed method on some benchmark dataset to classify the news as real or fake.
